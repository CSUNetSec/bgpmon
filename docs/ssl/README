on a node with cassandra installed
./createcert <password> <hostname0> <hostname1> ...
where hostnameN is the hostname of the cluster node

this will create:
 a file called cassandra-HOSTNAME.cer as well as a .keystore-HOSTNAME for every hostname in the arglist
 a common file .truststore that will have all the certificates added in as a trusted source.

proceed to copy the individual .keystore-HOSTANE as well as the shared .truststore to the relevant nodes.
make sure that the .keystore-HOSTNAME file is readable only by the cassandra user (typically cassandra)
