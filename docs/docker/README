Stress Testing
--------------
To test inserting data
```bash
./bin/cassandra-stress user profile=./blogpost.yaml ops\(insert=1\)
```

To test a query
```bash
./bin/cassandra-stress user profile=blogpost.yaml ops\(singlepost=1\)
```

Start Cluster Script
--------------------
start-cluster.sh
	-d DATA_DIRECTORY
		The directory on the local machine where cassandra data will be physcially stored by the docker containers
	-i IP_LIST
		A space separated list of comma separated lists of IP addresses that correspond to the collector IP addresses for each of the cassandra instances
	-p CONTAINER_PREFIX
		The prefix of docker container names. If not provided "CAS" is the default

--EXAMPLE--
./start-cluster.sh -d /raid/cassandra_bgp/docker_data -i 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.1 2.2.2.2,3.3.3.3 -p CASSANDRA

The above command will create 3 docker containers. The data for each cassandra instance will be stored in directories named "CASSANDRA1", "CASSANDRA2", and "CASSANDRA3" and will be located in the "/raid/cassandra_bgp/docker_data directory. The first two cassandra instances are both responsible for a single collector IP address namely, 0.0.0.0 and 1.1.1.1 respectively. The third cassandra instance is responsible for data from collecter IP's 2.2.2.2 and 3.3.3.3.

Stop Cluster Script
-------------------
shutdown-cluster.sh
	-d DATA_DIRECTORY
		The directory on the local machine where cassandra data will be physcially stored by the docker containers
	-p CONTAINER_PREFIX
		The prefix of docker container names. If not provided "CAS" is the default

--EXAMPLE--
./shutdown-cluster.sh -d /raid/cassandra_bgp/docker_data -p CASSANDRA

The above command will stop and remove all docker containers with the name prefix "CASSANDRA". In addition it will delete the directories storing the cassandra data in the "/raid/cassandra_bgp/docker_data" directory
